## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **1. Update Backend Models**
Your `backend/src/models.py` needs to be updated to match the new schema. The current models are for the old simple marketplace system.

### **2. Create Sample Data**
```python
# Example: Create a sample shop and users
python create_sample_data.py
```

### **3. Test API Endpoints**
Update your FastAPI endpoints to work with the new multi-tenant architecture.

### **4. Frontend Integration**
Update any frontend code to work with the shop-based system.

---

## 💡 **Key Business Workflow Examples**

### **Shop Setup Flow:**
1. Superadmin creates shop with plan assignment
2. Shop owner user created and linked
3. Products and categories configured
4. Commission rules established

### **Transaction Completion Flow:**
1. Farmer delivers stock → `farmer_stock` created
2. Buyer purchases → `transaction` + `transaction_item` created
3. Payment processing → `buyer_paid_amount` updated
4. Farmer settlement → `farmer_paid_amount` updated  
5. Owner commission confirmation → `commission_confirmed` = true
6. Status automatically updates to 'complete'

### **Credit Management Flow:**
1. Buyer takes credit → `credit` + `credit_detail` created
2. Partial payments → `payment` records with credit reference
3. Credit status automatically updated
